# My Terrarium

This project is a simple, interactive terrarium that displays a variety of plants in a glass jar. It's built with HTML and CSS, and it's a great example of how to use CSS to create realistic effects.

## Project Structure

The project consists of an HTML file (`index.html`) styled with CSS file (`style.css`) that contains the structure of the terrarium, and a CSS file that contains the styles. The terrarium includes a glass jar and several plants.

## How to Use

To view the terrarium, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. You'll see a glass jar in the middle of the screen, with plants on either side.
